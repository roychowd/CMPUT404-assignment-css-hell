# Gutenberg Edit Explanations:

===============

I implemented a "dark" colorscheme. White text on black background so its easier for users to read. I changed the font style of the paragraph, header, and pre texts to Code Pro since I beleive that it makes the text stand out better on screens.

Furthermore, for images and the headers I implemented a white border to make it look more important. I centered the headers in relation to the borders.
